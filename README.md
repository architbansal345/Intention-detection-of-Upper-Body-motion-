The key objective of this project is to determine the intention of Upper Body motion of human beings
using Electromyography(EMG). For this purpose we have used two types of analysis:

• Firstly the data analytics, it is used to visualize how the data would be behaving depending on the motion of the hand.

• Secondly, we used machine learning models to train and test our data that we obtained while performing the experiment. By studying these two thoroughly we have made a real time analysis interface that judges
the motion of the arm and detects whether the hand is in upward motion or in downward motion.
